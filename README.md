# powerLabel
PowerLabel is a solution for scanning computer systems quickly and registering them in a database.
It is also designed to be able to print labels with the system specifications.

PowerLabel is currently being used by [me](https://github.com/itssiem) to speed up the workflow at [Queen Systems](https://www.queensystems.nl)
while also providing more information to the users about the components in a system.

## Features
* Quick scanning of computer systems
* Detailed information about components
* Relational database to keep track of all the system components and configurations

## Installation
Instructions to set this up yourself are coming soon!
